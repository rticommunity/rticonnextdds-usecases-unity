===========================================

Case + Code Overview
--------------------
This repository is part of Real-Time Innovations' Case + Code project, a project to create code for real-world RTI Connext DDS use cases.

This use case shows how RTI Connext DDS can be integrated with the Unity gaming engine to create a dynamic visualization of DDS Data and to show how Unity can be integrated into your DDS-based system.

This use case example should be a stepping stone for creating real distributed applications based on RTI Connext DDS. Additional information about this use case can be found on [RTI's Case + Code page](https://www.rti.com/developers/case-code/unity-gaming).


RTI Connext DDS Overview
------------------------
RTI Connext DDS software includes the world's leading implementation of the Object Management Group (OMG) Data Distribution Service (DDS). DDS is the only open standard for messaging that supports the unique needs of both enterprise and real-time systems. Its open interfaces and advanced integration capabilities slash costs across a system's lifecycle, from initial development and integration through on-going maintenance and upgrades.

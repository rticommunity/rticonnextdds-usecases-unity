 RTI Connext DDS Use Case: Gaming Visualizations with RTI Connext® and Unity® Integration
=====================================

## Concept
This use case example includes the final files created within the Unity Integration Modules

This includes the XML file used within the application to dynamically generate the DDS objects used by the Unity application, as well as the final scene, prefabs, and scripts.

## Additional Documentation
Detailed documentation for this example is available online at:

## Download RTI Connext DDS
If you do not already have RTI Connext DDS installed, download and install it
now. You can use a 30-day trial license to try out the product. Your download
will include the libraries that are required to run the example, and tools you
can use to visualize and debug your distributed system.

You can download RTI Connext here: https://www.rti.com/downloads/

## How to Use this Code
On all platforms, the first thing you must do is set an environment variable
called `NDDSHOME`. This environment variable must point to the
rti_connext_dds-x.y.z directory inside your RTI Connext DDS installation. For
more information on how to set an environment variable, please see the RTI
Core Libraries and Utilities Getting Started Guide.

These files are meant to be used within Unity and specifically with the tutorial
referenced above.
